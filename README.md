# Template: Standard Robot Framework
This is the simplest template to start from.
- Get started from a simple task template in `tasks.robot`.
  - Uses [Robot Framework](https://robocorp.com/docs/languages-and-frameworks/robot-framework/basics) syntax.
- You can configure your robot `robot.yaml`.
- You can configure dependencies in `conda.yaml`.
